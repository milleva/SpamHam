# SpamHam Naive Bayes Classifier

Instructions:

in /src/Spamham<br>
alter the constant MESSAGE_PATH with any .txt file on line 15.
The program outputs the probability of the file being a spam
email (vs. a wanted email)

The program is fed training data from open source spam message examples and "ham" message examples. It then uses the Naive
Bayes conditional probabilistic model to estimate the outcome of classes "Spam" and "Ham". In this particular program the output 
probability is for Spam.
